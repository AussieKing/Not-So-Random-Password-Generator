# 02 - JavaScript : Random Password Generator

## Description
This JavaScript application was developed to provide the user an interactive, secure and customizable way to generate random passwords. The application prompts the user to decide what to include in their password (length between 8 and 128 characters, inclusion of upper/lower cases and/or special charachters).
The application will print the result (password) in the dialogue box.

## Usage
The JavaScript file allows us to create random password using (for)loops, Math.random and othe JavaScript properties.

Here, you will see how the website looks on larger screens.

This application doesn't require the user to enter the Console in order to see the printed result, keeping in mind the user experience (resulting in a more intuitive and easy to navigate end-result).

The User simply needs to click the Generate Password button to get started.

Once that happens, the user is asked to select the criteria they'd like their password to include (length of characters, inclusion of lower/uppercase,numeric or special characters).

Once the user has selected all criteria, the password will be displayed.

NOTE: as long as the length selected is entered (between 8 and 24 characters) and at least one criteria is selected, the password will generate.
In this example, the user only selected Special Characters.

## Development & Deployment
This website is programmed using using VS Code, and checked on Chrome DevTools to make sure that no errors were logged.


Given the HTML and CSS framework, we had to create a JavaScript file that met the criteria of the job assigned.
In this case, I followd the basic concept of ASSIGN (values and actions), CREATE (variables and if scenarios), APPEND (to insert the strings).
